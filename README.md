## Overview

The notebooks in this repository explore various datasets using EDA techniques to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, frame hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

## File Descriptions

Here is a list of the Jupyter notebooks included in this repository along with a brief description of each:

- **Spam_and_not_Spam_Emails.ipynb**: This notebook performs EDA on a dataset of emails, classifying them as spam or not spam. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature exploration, and visualization to understand the characteristics that differentiate spam emails from non-spam emails.
  
- **Titanic_kaggle_com.ipynb**: This notebook contains the EDA for the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset provided by Kaggle. The analysis explores the relationship between various features (e.g., age, gender, class) and the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic. The notebook also visualizes key insights using plots and graphs.

## How to Use
